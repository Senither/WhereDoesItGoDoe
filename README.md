## WhereDoesItGoDoe?

WhereDoesItGoDoe is a really simple bot created for Discord using the [JDA framework](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) written in Java 8.

All the bot does is scan messages for links, and then checks if they redirect anywhere, if the message does contain a link and it does redirect to some other site the bot will tell you where it redirects to, and if there are more than one redirects it will also let you know about all the sites in between.
